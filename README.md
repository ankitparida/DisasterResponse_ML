# DISASTER RESPONSE NLP MODEL

## Introduction

The primary aims of disaster response are rescue from immediate danger and stabilization of the physical and emotional condition of survivors. These go hand in hand with the recovery of the dead and the restoration of essential services such as water and power. 

In this Project, we'll work with data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. This dataset will help in building a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that we can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
